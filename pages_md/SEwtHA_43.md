Right: the energy gap created by UK power station closures, as projected by energy company EdF. This graph shows the predicted *capacity* of nuclear, coal, and oil power stations, in kilowatt-hours per day per person. The capacity is the maximum deliverable power of a source.

Figure K.3. Electricity demand in Great Britain (in kWh/d per person) during two winter weeks of 2006. The peaks in January are at 6pm each day. (If you’d like to obtain the national demand in GW, the top of the scale, 24 kWh/d per person, is the same as 60 GW per UK.)

facturers \[<span class="websitetitle">www.q400.com</span>\], uses 3.81 litres per 100 passenger-km (at a cruise speed of 667 km/h), which is an energy cost of <span class="mauve">38 kWh per 100 p-km</span>. The full 747 has an energy cost of <span class="mauve">42 kWh per 100 p-km</span>. So both planes are twice as fuel-efficient as a single-occupancy car. (The car I’m assuming here is the average European car that we discussed in Chapter 3.)

#### Is flying extra-bad for climate change in some way?

Yes, that’s the experts’ view, though uncertainty remains about this topic \[<span class="websitetitle">3fbufz</span>\]. Flying creates other greenhouse gases in addition to CO<sub>2</sub>, such as water and ozone, and indirect greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxides. If you want to estimate your carbon footprint in tons of CO<sub>2</sub>equivalent, then you should take the actual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of your flights and bump them up two- or three-fold. This book’s diagrams don’t include that multiplier because here we are focusing on our *energy* balance sheet.

<span class="mark">35</span>*Boeing 747-400* – data are from \[<span class="tinylink">9ehws</span>\]. Planes today are not completely full. Airlines are proud if their average full­ ness is 80%. Easyjet planes are 85% full on average. (Source: <span class="websitetitle">thelondonpaper</span> Tuesday 16th January, 2007.) An 80%-full 747 uses about 53 kWh per 100 passenger-km. What about short-haul flights? In 2007, Ryanair, “Europe’s greenest airline,” delivered transportation at a cost of <span class="darkred">37 kWh per 100 p-km</span> \[<span class="tinylink">3exmgv</span>\]. This means that flying across Europe with Ryanair has much the same energy cost as having all the passengers drive to their destination in cars, two to a car. (For an indication of what other airlines might be delivering, Ryanair’s fuel burn rate in 2000, before their environment-friendly investments, was above <span class="darkred">73 kWh per 100 p-km</span>.) London to Rome is 1430 km; London to Malaga is 1735 km. So a round-trip to Rome with the greenest airline has an energy cost of 1050 kWh, and a round-trip to Malaga costs 1270 kWh. If you pop over to Rome and to Malaga once per year, your average power consumption is 6.3 kWh/d with the greenest airline, and perhaps 12 kWh/d with a less green one. What about frequent flyers? To get a silver frequent flyer card from an in­ tercontinental airline, it seems one must fly around 25 000 miles per year in economy class. That’s about 60 kWh per day, if we scale up the opening numbers from this chapter and assume planes are 80% full. Here are some additional figures from the Intergovernmental Panel on Cli­ mate Change \[<span class="tinylink">yrnmum</span>\]: a full 747-400 travelling 10 000 km with low-density seating (262 seats) has an energy consumption of <span class="darkred">50 kWh per 100 p-km</span>. In a high-density seating configuration (568 seats) and travelling 4000 km, the
